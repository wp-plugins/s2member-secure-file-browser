== Description ==

s2Member Secure File Browser is a wordpress plugin for browsing files from the secure-files location of the [s2Member® WordPress Memberships](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/s2member/ "s2Member") plugin.

**Shortcode**

You can display the file browser via the shortcode `[s2member_secure_files_browser /]`.

The shortcode will display a file browser item with only granted directories for current user.

The shortcode can handle :

* `access-s2member-level0` directory for level #0 and more users
* `access-s2member-level1` directory for level #1 and more users
* `access-s2member-level2` directory for level #2 and more users
* `access-s2member-level3` directory for level #3 and more users
* `access-s2member-level4` directory for level #4 and more users
* `access-s2member-ccap-*` custom capabilities directories for according users
* any directory for all users in read only (unable to download)

All these featured folders can be located anywhere and they can be used several times.

Clicking on a file will launch the download according to the s2member files access control.

Please use the shortcode generator in the *Dashboard > s2Member Menu > Secure File Browser* to generate complex values.

== Installation ==

**Requirement** : you need to install first the wonderful and free s2Member® plugin [available here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/s2member/ "s2Member")

**s2member Secure File Browser** is very easy to install (instructions) :
* Upload the `/s2member-secure-file-browser` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress®.


== Frequently asked questions ==

= s2Member secure files are always directly downloadable, how can I protect them by forcing php handling ? =

It is recommended to add a `deny from all` directive in your `httpd.conf` for your s2member-files directory in order to avoid people directly access your protected files. Do not put the `deny` directive in the `s2member-files/.htaccess` because this file is always regenerated by s2member and your modifications are always overwritten.

= Why s2member-files/.htaccess is not displayed ? =

Even if you set shortcode option `hidden` to `1`, `.htaccess` will never been displayed.

= Are directories `access-s2member-level*` protected if they are not in the root directory ? =

Yes ! `And access-s2member-ccap*` too !

= The browser does not work, it displays `Invalid nonce` for registered users. =

The authentication on your website is broken because of a plugin (AJAX requests not correctly handled).
This behaviour is correct and it is protecting your files !
It happens for example when your authentication is only performed in a HTTPS form and the navigation is done in HTTP.
If you use the `Wordpress HTTP` plugin from http://mvied.com/projects/wordpress-https/ for example, you have to force HTTPS on each page which includes the s2member Secure File browser.

= How to handle the `s2member-files/app_data` windows directory ? =

In windows installations, put all files in `s2member-files\app_data` instead of `s2member-files` directory.
